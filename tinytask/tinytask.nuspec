TinyTask provides quick and easy automation by recording-playback.
It is a case study in minimalist programming: the entire program is only 32k -- and over 14k are graphics, which means the executable portion is very small and efficient.
It is used as the test harness for the "Recording" feature of vTask Studio.
New: now includes an EXE compiler! Turn your recordings into standalone programs.
If you were stranded on a remote island, this is the one program you would want.
There's no installer, required files, or anything unnecessary; just a tiny program, which doesn't touch your registry or system folders. Enjoy!
