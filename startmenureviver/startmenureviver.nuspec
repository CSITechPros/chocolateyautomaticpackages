-Revive your Start Menu-
Don't just replace your Start Menu - revive it.
Start Menu Reviver is designed for you, whether you just want a Start Menu back in Windows 8, or want to have more control in Windows 7.
Start Menu Reviver is the only choice that brings back the familiarity you're accustomed to and embraces the enhancements in the future of Windows.
-Truly Touchscreen-Friendly-
The unique tile structure in Start Menu Reviver means that it is the only Start Menu that is truly touch-friendly.
-Start Your Way-
Start Menu Reviver accommodates up to 32 tiles so you can customize it for a truly personal experience. Choose which applications, documents, folders and more you want to launch directly from your Start Menu.
You can also change the tile images using our ever-growing library of icons, or create your very own.
Of course you can still use your mouse and keyboard, but with Start Menu Reviver you can also easily add, remove, move and edit at the touch of a finger.
-Manage Desktop and Modern Applications-
Launch both traditional desktop programs and new Windows 8 modern applications directly from the the Start Menu. No other product allows you to do this.
