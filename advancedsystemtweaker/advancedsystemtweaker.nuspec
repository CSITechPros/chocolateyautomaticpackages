Advanced System Tweaker is a central hub for any kind of tweak or anything else that can be done via registry files, commands and vbscript files.
The add-ons in the program allow it to grow and handle just about anything.
The program has a direct link to search and find the growing list of add-ons.
Using the program is easy. Browse through the installed add-ons and runs the one you want.
For a 1 click solution you can use Simple System Tweaker.
