Waterfox is basically a 64-bit version of Firefox.
The Firefox source code is taken and compiled to run specifically for 64-bit Windows computers.
To make Waterfox stand out a bit more, it is compiled with optimizations so that it will run more efficiently and faster than just compiling Firefox as a 64-bit program.
In benchmarks, the 64-bit variant of Firefox out-performs the 32-bit variant.
Also because this variant is being built specifically for Windows, there might be further performance increases.
