SpiderOak provides an easy, secure and consolidated free online backup, storage, access, sharing and sync tool for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora).
SpiderOak offers a different approach to online backup, synchronization, and sharing.
This difference is not just measured in our zero-knowledge privacy policy - the first one ever employed in this setting - but also in our flexible design in handling data from all platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux) and locations (external drives, network volumes, USB keys) in one centralized account.
A Sync may exist between any two or more folders including two folders that exist as part of the same machine (e.g. between a desktop and an external hard-drive).
Any items placed inside Hive will automatically upload and then sync to all your other devices (thus effectively replicating the Dropbox folder).
