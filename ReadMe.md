If you want to see example packages to create others download my repo kicking "Download .zip" or otherwise and execute "ketarin.exe" inside the "KETARIN-chocopkgup" folder. They aren't perfect, are improvable.

If you want to know more, go to the wiki of this repo [here](https://github.com/tonigellida/chocolateyautomaticpackages/wiki).

If there's an outdated version or an error:

* Do a PR. Recommended!
* You can contact me.

Causes of errors:

* My mistake, I'm human, not perfect.
* I don't have a system 100% autonomous for all packages, so I've to update manually a few packages, specially prerelease versions.
* Author doesn't update the version number on his web or on the web where I found the version isn't updated.
* Place where are version and installer is changed, so the package doesn't works.

Package versions erased:

* driverbooster. Stable versions erased. Changed to correct beta version.
