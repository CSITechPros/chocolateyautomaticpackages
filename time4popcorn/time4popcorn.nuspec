YTS Release. Watch movies free on your desktop, with a big movie catalog.
This p2p client offers a whole new way to watch movies. Just select the movie to watch and press play.
Popcorn Time! is the result of many developers and designers putting a bunch of APIs together to make the experience of watching torrent movies as simple as possible.
-Great movies
We're constantly searching all over the web for the best torrents from the most important sites.
-No restrictions
Watch any movie as many times as you want. All you need to get started is a proper internet connection.
-Awesome catalogue
If the movie is out there, Popcorn Time will find the best version possible and start streaming it right away.
-The best quality
Watch your movie instantly in HD and with subtitles. And then keep watching.
