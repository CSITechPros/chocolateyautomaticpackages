WinLockLess is a free utility that protects your PC against any installation attempt by viruses, Trojans and scareware, such as police dreaded virus.His vigilance is fierce.
WinLockLess prevents certain programs modify Windows registry keys to start automatically. By denying the permission on these areas, executing becomes impossible.
For that WinLockLess to work, it is necessary to stay loaded in memory. Nor do you need to install it. With running it once is enough. Remember to have .NET Framework 4.0 installed on Windows to start WinLockLess.
As a first layer of protection against viruses that are installed on Windows startup, WinLockLess is very effective, but does not replace, nor intended, an updated antivirus real-time protection.
