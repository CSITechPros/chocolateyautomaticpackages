Isoplex is a movie searching and streaming application. It is digging the web to find a movie you want so you can stream it in any available quality without downloading.
Technologies we use are:

-node-webkit
-socket.io
-peerflix
-backbone.js
-some back-end magic

Some may think we're a Popcorn Time clone with slightly different interface, but we are not.
For sure Popcorn Time set a high bar in content streaming. We want to join the technological race! Not against them but with them.

The product is in a very early stage. We may experience downtime, content problems and other bugs.
But we strive to deliver a great product for you following your precious feedback. So please be patient and stay tuned!
And yes, we are closed-source at the moment. But if you would like to contribute to the project you're welcome to contact us at http://isohunt.to/contact-us.
